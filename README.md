## Development

- Open this folder in Android Studio. Use JDK 17+, Android SDK Platform 37.0 and Build Tools 36.0.0. The app targets API 36 and supports API 26+. SDK location belongs in ignored `local.properties` or `ANDROID_HOME`.
- Use the committed, checksum-pinned Gradle wrapper. Dependencies are pinned in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- `app` contains Android UI/platform/persistence code; `core/learning` contains Android-independent learning logic.

```sh
./gradlew :core:learning:test
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug :app:lintDebug
```

Actual executed checks and limits are in [test results](docs/TEST_RESULTS.md). A debug build, once successful, is at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

No account, embedded API credentials, analytics or paid service is enabled. Do not push, deploy, reset progress or activate paid APIs without authorization. Quranic material requires verified sources and licenses before inclusion.
